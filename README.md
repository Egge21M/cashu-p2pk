# Cashu-P2PK
A demo / POC for interactions with NUT-11 P2PK locked nuts in the web

## Requirements
In order to use this demo you got to have Alby installed and a nostr-key setup within. Unfortunately Alby is the only NIP-07 provider that implements the required `signSchnorr()` method right now.

## Installation
Starting the dev server is easy:

```sh
# Install all dependencies
npm install
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
# Optional: Build the project for deployment
npm run build
```
